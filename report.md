📘 **Backstory–Narrative Consistency Verification System**
Track A: Systems Reasoning with NLP & Generative AI
1. 🧩 Problem Statement

Input

A full-length novel (100k+ words)

A hypothetical backstory for a central character

Task
Determine whether the proposed backstory is consistent with the narrative as a whole.

This goes beyond surface-level contradiction detection.
The system verifies:

Consistency over time

Causal coherence

Respect for narrative constraints

Evidence-based reasoning across the text

2. 🧠 System Overview

We model the task as hypothesis verification:

Novel → Ground truth

Backstory → Hypothesis

The system combines semantic retrieval, claim-level reasoning, and deterministic aggregation to produce a final binary decision.

🔗 High-Level Pipeline
Full Novel
 → Chunking & Indexing (Pathway)
 → Hypothetical Backstory
 → Claim Decomposition
 → Semantic Evidence Retrieval
 → Claim-Level Reasoning (LLM)
 → Deterministic Aggregation
 → Final Binary Decision (results.csv)

 
3. 📚 Long-Context Handling: Novel Chunking & Indexing

The complete novel is processed without truncation.

Chunking Strategy

The novel is split into overlapping text chunks

Each chunk represents a localized narrative unit (scene / paragraph group)

Every chunk is assigned a unique chunk_id

Benefits

Scalable handling of long narratives

Focused evidence retrieval

Preservation of global narrative coherence

4. 🧱 Pathway Integration (Track A Requirement)

Pathway’s Python framework serves as the semantic retrieval backbone.

Pathway is used to:

Ingest and store novel chunks

Generate semantic embeddings

Build a vector index for meaning-based search

Retrieve narrative evidence relevant to backstory claims

🔍 Semantic indexing enables retrieval by meaning rather than exact keywords, which is essential for reasoning about character behavior and development.

5. 🧬 Hypothetical Backstory & Claim Decomposition

The hypothetical backstory is provided as an external input (not generated by the system).

To enable structured evaluation, the backstory is decomposed into atomic, testable claims, such as:

Beliefs

Fears

Motivations

Formative experiences

Worldview assumptions

Each claim is labeled as:

Core → Fundamental to character identity or long-term motivation

Non-core → Secondary or contextual detail

This avoids vague, holistic judgments and enables precise reasoning.

6. 🔎 Semantic Retrieval of Narrative Evidence

For each backstory claim:

A semantic query is issued to the Pathway index

Multiple relevant narrative chunks are retrieved

Evidence may include:

Actions

Dialogue

Internal monologue

Repeated behavioral patterns

This ensures decisions are grounded in signals from multiple parts of the text, not isolated passages.

7. 🤖 Claim-Level Consistency Reasoning (LLM)

Each claim is evaluated against the retrieved evidence using an LLM.

The model assesses:

Whether the claim is supported, contradicted, or unconstrained

Whether it preserves causal consistency

Whether character behavior remains coherent over time

Output Encoding

score = 1 → Consistent

score = 0 → Contradictory

⚠️ Absence of evidence is not treated as contradiction.

8. 🧮 Deterministic Aggregation Logic

Claim-level results are combined using a frozen, deterministic rule:

If any core claim has score = 0 → Contradict (0)

Otherwise → Consistent (1)

This prevents critical contradictions from being diluted by majority voting or probabilistic averaging.

9. 📥 Input & 📤 Output Specification
Input (Placeholder Structure)
{
  "story_XXX": {
    "claims": [
      {
        "claim_id": "claim_1",
        "score": 0 or 1,
        "core": true or false
      }
    ]
  }

Output (results.csv)
story_id,prediction,rationale


Fields

story_id → Unique identifier

prediction → 1 (Consistent) / 0 (Contradict)

rationale → Short human-readable explanation

Dummy Example

story_XXX,0,<a core backstory claim contradicts the narrative>
story_YYY,1,<all core backstory claims are consistent>

10. 🏁 Conclusion

This system provides a robust, explainable, and scalable approach to verifying backstory–narrative consistency in long-form fiction.

By combining:

Pathway-based semantic retrieval

Structured claim-level reasoning

Deterministic aggregation

the pipeline ensures evidence-grounded decisions while effectively handling long-context narratives.
